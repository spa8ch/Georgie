      <p>
        The Moreton Bay Art Competition is a local annual event that celebrates the creative talents of artists from across the Moreton Bay Region. Open to all ages and experience levels, this exciting competition invites painters, photographers, digital artists, and more to share their work with the wider community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Held in the heart of Moreton Bay, the competition features a public exhibition at the Redcliffe Art Gallery, where selected artworks are displayed for the community to enjoy. Visitors can view submissions, vote for their favourite pieces, and even purchase local art.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enter, artists can upload their work through the "Submit Art" page on this website. Submissions must include a title, a short description, and the artist's details. A panel of judges will review all entries, and winners will be announced at the closing ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're an emerging talent or an established artist, the Moreton Bay Art Competition is a great opportunity to gain exposure, connect with other creatives, and be part of a vibrant local art scene.
